# 2.Write a program which contains one class named as BankAccount.
# BankAccount class contains two instance variables as Name & Amount.
# That class contains one class variable as ROI which is initialise to 10.5.
# Inside init method initialise all name and amount variables by accepting the values from user.
# There are Four instance methods inside class as Display(), Deposit(), Withdraw(), CalculateIntrest().
# Deposit() method will accept the amount from user and add that value in class instance variable Amount.
# Withdraw() method will accept amount to be withdrawn from user and subtract that
# amount from class instance variable Amount.
# CalculateIntrest() method calculate the interest based on Amount by considering rate
# of interest which is Class variable as ROI.
# And Display() method will display value of all the instance variables as Name and Amount.
# After designing the above class call all instance methods by creating multiple objects.
